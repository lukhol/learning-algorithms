#### Description
Two pointers is a technique in which we are using two pointers to traverse the array in different speed / from different side. Some classic examples are:
1. One slow-runner and other fast-runner (it's more fast and slow pointer but it is still using two pointers)
2. One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end. They move towards each other until they both meet.
3. 

Two pointers can be used for:
- searching pairs in array
- palindrom check
