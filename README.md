# learning-algorithms
This repository contains my solutions to problems from multiple sites for training solving algorithm.

Idea is to do (ideally by the end of 2022)
1. All patterns and questions from https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview
2. Create template for each pattern
3. Finish AlgoExpert and place all solutions in this repository.


Future plans
1. Create visualizer for some algorithm / data structure, for example - graph, tree, sorting, balancing tree or other.
